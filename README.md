# VTKGGDTools

IMAS GGD-VTK is a tool to convert GGD ([Generalized Grid Description](https://sharepoint.iter.org/departments/POP/CM/IMDesign/Data%20Model/sphinx/dev/ggd_guide/doc.html)) 
structures to VTK formats, and back. This is complemented by a number of Paraview plugins that can visualise both GGD and non-GGD IDS data in Paraview.

## ⚠️ IMASPy migration

The code base has been migrated from the IMAS HLI to IMASPy. This has changed a
couple of things. There is no code generation step anymore. All Data Dictionary metadata is
accessed in run-time through IMASPy. This also means that any changes made
while developing apply without having to re-generate the plugin. To ensure proper functionality, 
it is recommended to use **IMASPy version 1.1.0 or higher**.
You can check your installed version using the following commands:

```bash
vtkggdtools --version
```

### Running on SDCC
```bash
module load GGD-VTK
paraview
# Open the "Sources" tab in the top left, and ensure you see "IMAS Tools" in 
# the drop down menu.
```

### Running development version on SDCC
Use the following instructions from the root of the project directory to run paraview:

```bash
# Load compatible IMASPy, IMAS and ParaView modules, like:
# AL5 and ParaView 5.12 (recommended on RHEL9):
module load IMASPy/1.1.1-foss-2023b \
IMAS-AL-Python/5.3.0-foss-2023b-DD-3.42.0 ParaView/5.12.0-foss-2023b
# export environment variables, this assumes the current
# working directory is the root of the repository
export PV_PLUGIN_PATH=$PWD/vtkggdtools/plugins:$PV_PLUGIN_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
# Use LD_PRELOAD to work around a VTK bug:
# https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/issues/19373
export LD_PRELOAD=$HDF5_DIR/lib/libhdf5.so.310
# Run paraview
paraview
# Open the "Sources" tab in the top left, if you see "IMAS Tools" in the drop down, 
# It is installed correctly.
```

Use the following instructions from the root of the project directory to run the 
command line interface:
```bash
# Load compatible IMASPy, IMAS and ParaView modules, like:
module load IMASPy/1.1.1-foss-2023b \
IMAS-AL-Python/5.3.0-foss-2023b-DD-3.42.0 ParaView/5.12.0-foss-2023b
# create virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv ./venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade wheel setuptools
# For development install in editable mode
pip install -e .[all]
# Run CLI with help information
vtkggdtools --help
# If you see the help page of the vtkggdtools, it is installed correctly.
```
