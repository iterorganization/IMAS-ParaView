Training Examples
=================

This section presents a step-by-step walkthrough of the examples from the IMAS-ParaView training held on June 17â€“18, 2025.

These steps assume that you have IMAS-ParaView up and running, for this see :ref:`installing`. Furthermore, it is assumed that you have access to SDCC, as example data is loaded which is available only on SDCC. It is advised to have some experience with IMAS-ParaView before starting this, so consider having a look at the instructions for :ref:`usage`. It is recommended to stick to the order as presented here, as the later training sections introduce more advanced concepts.

At the start of each section, a ParaView ``.pvsm`` state file is also provided for your convenience. This can be loaded into ParaView and this will automatically load the entire example setup for you. However, if it is your first time going through the examples, it is recommended to follow the step-by-step walkthrough manually, to get familiar with the workflow of IMAS-ParaView.
