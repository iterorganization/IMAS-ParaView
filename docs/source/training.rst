Training
========

This page explains the examples shown in the IMAS-ParaView training that took place 17th and 18th of June 2025. 

These steps assume that you have IMAS-ParaView up and running, for this see :ref:`installing`. It is advised to have some experience with IMAS-ParaView before starting this, so consider having a look at the instructions for :ref:`usage`. It is recommended to stick to the order as presented here, as the later training sections introduce more advanced concepts.

At the start of each section, a ParaView ``.pvsm`` state file is also provided for your convenience. This can be loaded into ParaView and loads the entire example setup for you.
